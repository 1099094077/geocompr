# Algorithms and functions for geocomputation

## Prerequisites {-}

In the introduction we promised to teach not how to use existing tools for Geocomputation in R, but also develop new ones, "in the form of shareable R scripts and functions".
This chapter aims to deliver on that promise.

We will consider example R scripts for geographic data and how to make them more reproducible in section \@ref(scripts).
Algorithms (or 'geoalgorithms' for geographic processes) are recipes for modifying inputs using a series of steps, resulting in an output, as described in section \@ref(geographic-algorithms).
To ease sharing and reproducibility algorithms can be placed into R function, which can then be distributed either in script files or as R packages, the building blocks of reproducible code.
That is the topic of section \@ref(functions).

It should be noted at the outset that none of these topics are specific to geographic data.
Although geoalgorithms do have a specific meaning originating in GIS software, most of the concepts apply in other domains.
For that reason instead of going into detail, our approach in this chapter is to provide illustrative examples and direct the reader to established resources, to avoid reinventing the wheel.

## Scripts

If packages are the building blocks of reproducible code, scripts are the glue that holds them together.
There are no strict rules on what can and cannot go into script files.
and nothing to prevent you from saving broken, non-reproducible code
There are, however, some rules of thumb and conventions worth following when writing R scipts, outlined below:

- Write the script in order. Just like the script of a play, scripts should have a clear order such as 'setup', 'data processing' and 'save results' (roughly equivalent to 'beginning', 'middle' and 'end' in a film).
- Make the script reproducible. Scripts will be of more use to you and others if they are self-contained and can be run by other people. This involves stating dependencies (loading required packages at the outset, like the 'Prerequisites' section), reading-in data from persistent sources (e.g. from a reliable website or API) and mentioning any code that must be run before running the script (e.g. with a comment `# run script0.R before this`).
- Comment the script sufficiently for others (and your future self) to understand it but not so much that the comments themselves become hard to maintain. At a minimum a good script file should contain information on the purpose of the script (see Figure \@ref(fig:codecheck)) and division into chunks, perhaps by appending `----` to section headings, which allows 'folding' of R scripts in RStudio.

Although there is no way to enforce reproducibility in R scripts, there are tools that can help.
By default RStudio 'code-checks' R scripts and underlines faulty code with a red way line, as illustrated below:

```{r codecheck, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Illustration of 'code checking' in RStudio, which identifies the incorrect dublicate pipe operator at the outset of a script."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/39698841-6e600584-51ee-11e8-9dd0-2c17b2836f79.png")
```


```{block2 spellcheck, type='rmdnote'}
A useful tool for reproducibility is the **reprex** package.
Its main function `reprex()` tests of lines of R code to check if they are reproduible, and provides markdown output to facilitate communication on sites such as GitHub.
See [reprex.tidyverse.org/](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) for details.

## Geographic algorithms

Algorithms can be understood as the computing equivalent of a cooking recipe.
An algorithm is a series of steps which, when taken on appropriate ingredients, results in an output that is more useful (or tasty) than the raw ingredients.
Before considering 'geoalgorithms', it is worth taking a brief detour to understand how algorithms relate to scripts and functions which are covered next.

The word algorithm comes from Baghdad when, in the 9^th^ Century AD, an early maths book was published called *Hisab al-jabr wâ€™al-muqabala*, the basis of the word *algebra*.
The book was translated into Latin and became so popular that the author Al-Khwarizmi "was immortalized as a scientific term: Al-Khwarizmi became Alchoarismi, Algorismi and, eventually, algorithm" [@bellos_alex_2011].

In the the computing age algorithm refers to a series of steps that take clearly defined input to produce an output.
Algorithms are often first envisioned flow charts and psuedocode showing the aim of the process before being implemented in a formal language such as R.
Because the same algorithm will be used many times on the different inputs it rarely makes sense to type out the entire algorithm each time: algorithms are most easily used when they are implemented inside functions (see section \@ref(functions)).

Geoalgorithms (also referred to as *GIS Algorithms*, in a book of the same name) are a special case of algorithm that take geographic data as input and, generally, return geographic results [@xiao_gis_2016].
A simple example is an algorithm that finds the centroid of an object.
This may sound like a simple task but in fact it involves some work, even for the simple case of single polygons containing no holes.
The basic representation of a polygon object is in a matrix representing the vertices between which straight lines are drawn (the first and last points must be the same, something we'll touch on later).
In this case we'll create a polygon with 19 vertices, following an example from [@xiao_gis_2016]:

```{r}
poly_csv = "0,5,10,15,20,25,30,40,45,50,40,30,25,20,15,10,8,4,0
            10,0,10,0,10,0,20,20,0,50,40,50,20,50,10,50,8,50,10"
poly_df = read.csv(text = poly_csv, header = FALSE)
poly_mat = t(poly_df)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
source("code/12-centroid-setup.R")
```
