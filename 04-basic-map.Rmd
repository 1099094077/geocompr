# Basic map making {#basic-map}

Like **sp**, basic maps in **sf** can be created quickly with the base `plot()` function. Unlike **sp**, however, **sf** by default creates a faceted plot, one sub-plot for each variable, as illustrated in the left-hand image in Figure \@ref(fig:sfplot). 

```{r sfplot, fig.cap="Plotting with sf, with multiple variables (left) and a single variable (right).", out.width="49%", fig.show='hold'}
plot(w)
plot(w["pop_est"])
```
