# Basic map making {#basic-map}

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
if(!exists("world"))
        source("code/03-attr.R")
```

Like **sp**, basic maps in **sf** can be created quickly with the base `plot()` function. Unlike **sp**, however, **sf** by default creates a faceted plot, one sub-plot for each variable, as illustrated in the left-hand image in Figure \@ref(fig:sfplot). 

```{r sfplot, fig.cap="Plotting with sf, with multiple variables (left) and a single variable (right).", out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', warning=FALSE}
plot(world)
plot(world["population"])
```
