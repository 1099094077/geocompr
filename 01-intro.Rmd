# Introduction {#intro}

This book exists at the intersection between two vast subjects, Geography and R are vast (Figure \@ref(fig:venn)).
It would make little sense to attempt a comprehensive coverage of either within a single book: .

```{r venn, fig.cap="Venn diagram of the intersection between Geography and R."}
library(sf)
p = st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 1)), st_point(c(1, 1)))
b = st_buffer(p, dist = 1)
plot(b)
text(x = c(-0.5, 1.5), y = 1, labels = c("Geography", "R"))
```
