# Introduction {#intro}

This book exists at the intersection between two vast subjects, Geography and R (Figure \@ref(fig:venn)).
It would make little sense to attempt a comprehensive coverage of either within a this book: this is a practical book.
This means that we will learn to *do* Geography, not talk about Geography, with R.
Actions often speak louder than words.
But before we crack-on with the action, a few words about the scope of this book are in order.

```{r venn, fig.cap="Venn diagram of the intersection between Geography and R."}
source("code/01-venn.R")
```
