Issues can be opened on the book's contents (see 1) its code (2) or general questions (3). 

(1) If it's a problem with the book's content please link to the place in the book where you found the problem. This is section 1.2, for example:

http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/intro.html#why-geocomputation-with-r

or edit the file directly - you can fix typos in that chapter from here, for example:

https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/edit/master/01-introduction.Rmd

(2) If it's a problem with the code please describe what you did and what you expected.
Include a minimal reproducible example (AKA a reprex) where possible. If you've never heard of a [reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, check out <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>.

If you have a general question, feel free to use this form. 
However, you may get a better response from another site (e.g at <https://stackoverflow.com/>, http://gis.stackexchange.com/ or <https://community.rstudio.com/>):
it may be quicker to check and post questions there.
