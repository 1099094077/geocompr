# Algorithms and functions {#algorithms}

## Prerequisites {-}

In chapter \@ref(intro) we promised to teach not only how to use existing tools for Geocomputation in R, but also develop new ones, "in the form of shareable R scripts and functions".
While reproducibility is central to the book, this chapter focusses on reproducibility and tool creation.

We will consider example R scripts for geographic data and how to make them more reproducible in section \@ref(scripts).
Algorithms are recipes for modifying inputs using a series of steps, resulting in an output, as described in section \@ref(geographic-algorithms).
To ease sharing and reproducibility algorithms can be placed into functions, which can then be distributed either in script files or as R packages, the building blocks of reproducible code.
That is the topic of section \@ref(functions).

<!-- This chapter provides illustrative examples and directs the reader to established resources, to avoid reinventing the wheel. -->
<!-- The approach taken in this chapter was partly inspired by @xiao_gis_2016, who advocates explanations that are neither highly theoretical (as many academic papers are) -->
<!-- , with dozens of lines of non-reproducible psuedo-code and equations -->
<!-- nor entirely focussed on implementations via a GUI or CLI in a particular sofware package (as the first part of this book is, with its focus on implementations in various R packages). -->
<!-- The focus of this chapter is on understanding, using reproducible code and clear explanation. -->
The algorithms developed (including finding the centroid of a polygon, an example used in this chapter) are readily available in GIS software.
However, the aim is "not to duplicate what is available out there, but to show how things out there work" [@xiao_gis_2016].
This chapter takes a similar approach and is therefore the most low-level and potentially advanced (in terms of the code, not application) so far.

## Scripts

If packages are the building blocks of reproducible code, scripts are the glue that holds them together.
There are no strict rules on what can and cannot go into script files and nothing to prevent you from saving broken, non-reproducible code.
There are, however, some rules of thumb and conventions worth following when writing R scipts, outlined below:

- Write the script in order: just like the script of a play, scripts should have a clear order such as 'setup', 'data processing' and 'save results' (roughly equivalent to 'beginning', 'middle' and 'end' in a film).
- Make the script reproducible: scripts will be of more use to you and others if they are self-contained and can be run by other people. This involves stating dependencies (loading required packages at the outset, like the 'Prerequisites' section), reading-in data from persistent sources (e.g. from a reliable website or API) and mentioning any code that must be run before running the script (e.g. with a comment `# run script0.R before this`).
- Comment the script sufficiently for others (and your future self) to understand it but not so much that the comments themselves become hard to maintain: at a minimum a good script file should contain information on the purpose of the script (see Figure \@ref(fig:codecheck)) and division into chunks, perhaps by appending `----` to section headings, which allows 'folding' of R scripts in RStudio.

Although there is no way to enforce reproducibility in R scripts, there are tools that can help.
By default RStudio 'code-checks' R scripts and underlines faulty code with a red way line, as illustrated below:

```{r codecheck, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Illustration of 'code checking' in RStudio, which identifies the incorrect dublicate pipe operator at the outset of a script."}

```


```{block2 spellcheck, type='rmdnote'}
A useful tool for reproducibility is the **reprex** package.
Its main function `reprex()` tests of lines of R code to check if they are reproduible, and provides markdown output to facilitate communication on sites such as GitHub.
See [reprex.tidyverse.org/](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) for details.
```

## Geographic algorithms

Algorithms can be understood as the computing equivalent of a cooking recipe:
a series of instructions which, when taken on appropriate ingredients, results in an output that is more useful (or tasty) than the raw ingredients.
Before considering 'geoalgorithms', it is worth taking a brief detour around the history of the algorithms, to understand how they relate to scripts and functions which are covered next.

The word algorithm comes from Baghdad when, in the 9^th^ Century AD, an early maths book was published called *Hisab al-jabr w’al-muqabala*.
The book was translated into Latin and became so popular that the author Muḥammad ibn Mūsā [al-Khwārizmī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi) "was immortalized as a scientific term: Al-Khwarizmi [sic] became Alchoarismi, Algorismi and, eventually, algorithm" [@bellos_alex_2011].^[
The book's title was also influential, forming the basis of the word *algebra*.
]

In the computing age algorithm refers to a series of steps that take a clearly defined input to produce an output.
Algorithms often start as in flow charts and psuedocode showing the aim of the process before being implemented in a formal language such as R.
Because the same algorithm will be used many times on the different inputs it rarely makes sense to type out the entire algorithm each time: algorithms are most easily used when they are implemented inside functions (see section \@ref(functions)).

Geoalgorithms are a special case: they take geographic data in and, generally, return geographic results.
Also referred to as *GIS algorithms* and *geometric algorithms*, an entire academic field --- *Computational Geometry*, a branch of computer science --- is dedicated to their study and development [@berg_computational_2008].
A simple example is an algorithm that finds the centroid of an object.
This may sound like a simple task but in fact it involves some work, even for the simple case of single polygons containing no holes.
The basic representation of a polygon object is in a matrix representing the vertices between which straight lines are drawn (the first and last points must be the same, something we'll touch on later).
In this case we'll create a polygon with 5 vertices in base R, building on an example from *GIS Algorithms* [@xiao_gis_2016 see [github.com/gisalgs](https://github.com/gisalgs/geom) for Python code]:

```{r centroid-setup, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# show where the data came from:
source("code/10-centroid-setup.R")
```

```{r}
x_coords = c(10, 2, 0, 0, 20, 10)
y_coords = c(0, 2, 10, 15, 20, 0)
poly_mat = cbind(x_coords, y_coords)
```

As with many computational (or other) problems, it makes sense to break the problem into smaller chunks.
All polygons can be broken-down into a finite number of triangles, which have simple rules defining their centroid and area.
With this in mind, the following commands create a new triangle (`T1`), that can be split-out from the polygon represented by `poly_mat`, and finds its centroid based on the [formula](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1702595/proof-for-centroid-formula-for-a-polygon)
$1/3(a + b + c)$ where $a$ to $c$ are coordinates representing the triangles vertices:

```{r}
O = poly_mat[1, ] # create a point representing the origin
T1 = rbind(O, poly_mat[2:3, ], O) # create 'triangle matrix'
C1 = (T1[1, ] + T1[2, ] + T1[3, ]) / 3 # find centroid
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Illustration of polygon centroid calculation problem."}
# initial plot: can probably delete this:
plot(poly_mat)
lines(poly_mat)
lines(T1, col = "blue", lwd = 5)
text(x = C1[1], y = C1[2], "C1")
```

If we calculate the centroids of all such polygons the solution should be the average x and y values of all centroids.
There is one problem though: some triangles are more important (larger) than others.
Therefore to find the geographic centroid we need to take the *weighted mean* of all sub-triangles, with weigths proportional to area. 
The formula to calculate the area of a triangle is:

$$
\frac{Ax ( B y − C y ) + B x ( C y − A y ) + C x ( A y − B y )}
{ 2 }
$$

Where $A$ to $C$ are the triangle's three points and $x$ and $y$ refer to the x and y dimensions.
A translation of this formula into R code that works with the data in the matrix representation of a triangle `T1` is:

```{r}
T1[1, 1] * (T1[2, 2] - T1[3, 2]) +
  T1[2, 1] * (T1[3, 2] - T1[1, 2]) +
  T1[3, 1] * (T1[1, 2] - T1[2, 2]) / 2
```

This code chunk works and outputs the correct result.^[
as can be verified with the formula for the area of a triangle whose base is horizontal: area equals half of the base width times its height --- $A = B * H / 2$ --- ($10 * 10 / 2$ in this case, as can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:polycent)).
]
The problem with the previous code chunk is that it is very verbose and difficult to re-run on another object with the same 'triangle matrix' format.
To make the code more generalizable, let's convert the code into a function (something described in \@ref(functions)):

```{r}
t_area = function(x) {
  (
    x[1, 1] * (x[2, 2] - x[3, 2]) +
    x[2, 1] * (x[3, 2] - x[1, 2]) +
    x[3, 1] * (x[1, 2] - x[2, 2])
  ) / 2
}
```

The function `t_area` generalizes the solution by taking any object `x`, assumed to have the same dimensions as the triangle represented in `T1`.
We can verify it works not only on the triangle matrix `T1` as follows:

```{r}
t_area(T1)
```

Likewise we can create a function that find's the triangle's centroid:

```{r}
t_centroid = function(x) {
  (x[1, ] + x[2, ] + x[3, ]) / 3
}
t_centroid(T1)
```

<!-- Commented-out because it makes more sense to do it in base R. Introduce decido later (Robin) -->
<!-- With these functions created and tested on the first triangle of the polygon, we can we can apply the solution to many triangles, which will be created with the **decido** package: -->

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ind = decido::earcut(poly_mat)
decido::plot_ears(poly_mat, idx = ind)
i = seq(1, length(ind), by = 3)
i_list = purrr::map(i, ~c(.:(.+2), .))
T_all = purrr::map(i_list, ~poly_mat[ind[.], ])
```

The next stage is to create the second triangle and calculate its area and centroid.
This is done in the code chunk below, which binds the 3^rd^ and 4^th coordinates onto the 1^st^, and uses the same functions we created above to calculate its area and width:

```{r}
T2 = rbind(O, poly_mat[3:4, ], O)
A2 = t_area(T2)
C2 = t_centroid(T2)
```

From this point it is not a big leap to see how to create the 3^rd^ and final triangle that constitutes the polygon represented by `poly_mat` (see exercises below).
However, an aim of algorithms is often to *generalise* and *automate* the solution.
In the name of automation (and to avoid creating individual triangles manually!) we use *iteration* to create all triangles representing the polygon in a single line.
We could use a `for()` loop or `lapply()` for this work but have chosen `map()` from the **purrr** package because it allows concise code:
the `.` in the commands below refer to 'each element of the object `i`' (see `?purrr::map` for details):

```{r}
# Aim: create all triangles representing a polygon
i = 2:(nrow(poly_mat) - 2)
Ti = purrr::map(i, ~rbind(O, poly_mat[.:(. + 1), ], O))
A = purrr::map_dbl(Ti, ~t_area(.))
C = t(sapply(Ti, t_centroid))
```

We are now in a position to calculate the total area and geographic centroid of the polygon as follows:

```{r}
sum(A)
weighted.mean(C[, 1], A)
weighted.mean(C[, 2], A)
```

Is this right?
We can verify the answer by converting `poly_mat` into a simple feature collection as follows:

```{r}
library(sf)
poly_sfc = st_polygon(list(poly_mat))
st_area(poly_sfc)
st_centroid(poly_sfc)
```



```{r polycent, fig.cap="Illustration of centroid calculation.", echo=FALSE}
plot(poly_mat)
lines(poly_mat)
lines(T1, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
text(x = C1[1], y = C1[2], "C1", col = "blue")
lines(Ti[[2]], col = "red", lwd = 2)
text(x = C[2, 1], y = C[2, 2], "C2", col = "red")
```


```{r}
library(sf)
T_sf = list(poly_mat) %>% 
  st_polygon()
st_area(T_sf)
```

## Functions

## Case study

## Exercises

1. In section \@ref(geographic-algorithms) we created a function that finds the geographic centroid of a shape, which is implemented in the **sf** function `st_centroid()`.
Building on this example, write a function only using base R functions that can find the total length of linestrings represented in matrix form.

<!-- Todo: add example of matrix representing a linestring, demonstrate code to verify the answer, suggest alternative functions to decompose as a bonus. -->
