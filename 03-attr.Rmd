# Working with attribute table {#attr}

To be proficient at working with attribute data in **sf** means being proficient with handling data frames in R. This is a broad topic beyond the scope of this tutorial. However, it is worth demonstrating how compatible objects of `sf` class are with methods for handling datasets.

```{r}
# subsetting simple feature rows
selr = grep(pattern = "z", x = w$name)
wz = w[selr,]
plot(wz[1])
```

```{r}
# subsetting simple feature columns
selc = 1:3
w_few_cols = w[selc]
head(w_few_cols)
```
