# Introduction {#intro}

<!-- Uncomment when it becomes a book -->
<!-- This book exists at the intersection between two vast subjects, Geography and R (Figure \@ref(fig:venn)). -->
<!-- It would make little sense to attempt a comprehensive coverage of either within a this book: this is a practical book. -->
<!-- This means that we will learn to *do* Geography, not talk about Geography, with R. -->

<!-- ## Why Geography with R? -->

<!-- Of Geography and R, the former is certainly the larger. -->
<!-- Geography as an academic discipline has over 2,000 years of history, notwithstanding the largely undocumented map-making skills of our prehistoric ancestors. -->

<!-- In this book we treat R as a 'tool for the trade', in a similar way that early geographers used rulers, compasses, sextants and other instruments to advance knowledge about the world. -->

##

Actions often speak louder than words, so this is a deliberately practical tutorial.
But before we crack-on with the action, however, a few introductory remarks are needed to explain the approach taken here and provide context.

This tutorial exists at the interface between two vast topics, Geography and R (Figure \@ref(fig:venn)).
