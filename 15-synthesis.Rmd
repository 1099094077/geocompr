# Synthesis and next steps

## Prerequisites {-}

Like the opening chapter, this final chapter contains minimal code.
Although it has no software requirements, it has the hardest prerequisites of any chapter: to have studied the book's contents in depth.
It assumes that you have:

- read-through and tried the exercises at the end of each chapter in Part 1 (Foundations)
- completed or at least engaged with all of the chapters in Part 2 (Extensions)
- thought about how Geocomputation can solve real-world problems, perhaps with reference to the chapters in Part 3 (Applications).
