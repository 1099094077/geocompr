# Conclusion: synthesis and next steps

## Prerequisites {-}

Like Chapter \@ref(intro) this, the last in the book, has minimal code.
However, its prerequisites are most demanding.
It assumes that you have:

- read-through, and attempted the exercises in, all chapters of Part 1 (Foundations)
- grasped the diversity of methods that build on these foundations, by following the code and prose in Part 2 (Extensions)
- considered how you can use geocomputation to solve real-world problems, at work or beyond, having engaged with the chapters in Part 3 (Applications).

Its aim is to synthsise the body of knowledge disseminated in the book and inspire future directions of application and development.
Section \@ref(concepts) reviews the content covered in the previous chapters but at a high level.
Its focus is on the concepts learned, rather than the details of the packages, functions and arguments required to complete the code chunks.
Section \@ref(gaps) 

## Concepts for geocomputation

## Gaps and overlaps

## Geocomputation for social benefit

Section \@ref(what-is-geocomputation) outlined the origins of the term geocomputation and its broad definition as a field that uses geographic data creatively to solve real world problems.
Building on these components we added another term that we hope sticks: reproducibility.
Like any worthwhile intellectual endeavour or nascent academic field geocomputation is diverse and contested.
An editorial celebrating '21+ years of geocomputation' reflects on two decades of research that falls under the geocomputational banner [harris_more_2017].
