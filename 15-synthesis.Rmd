# Conclusion: synthesis and next steps

## Prerequisites {-}

Like Chapter \@ref(intro) this, the last in the book, has minimal code.
However, its prerequisites are most demanding.
It assumes that you have:

- read-through, and attempted the exercises in all chapters of Part 1 (Foundations)
- grasped the diversity of methods that build on these foundations, by following the code and prose in Part 2 (Extensions)
- considered how you can use geocomputation to solve real-world problems, at work or beyond, having engaged with the chapters in Part 3 (Applications).

Its aim is to synthsise the body of knowledge disseminated in the book and inspire future directions of application and development.
Section \@ref(concepts) reviews the content covered in the previous chapters but at a high level.
Its focus is on the concepts learned, rather than the details of the packages, functions and arguments required to complete the code chunks.

## Concepts for geocomputation {#concepts}

## Gaps and overlaps {#gaps}

## Where next? {#next}

Learning geocomputation with R is challenging and there is much more to discover.
We have progressed quickly.
The jump from chapters \@ref(spatial-class) to \@ref(eco) is large:
the creation and manipulation of simple spatial objects Part I may seem a world away from the analysis of large datasets covered in Part III.
It is impossible to become an expert in any area by reading a single book, and skills must be practiced.
This section points toward sensible next steps on your geocomputational journey, **highlighted in bold below**.
<!-- and ordered by difficulty, beginning with continue to improve your knowledge of R. -->

The language of R is a shared thread connecting all the chapters.
All the analyses are based on R classes, primarily `sf` and `raster`, which in turn build on the base R classes of `data.frame` and `matrix`.
The wider point is the importance of *depth of understanding*.
This observation suggests a direction of travel: **improving your understanding of the R language**.
A next step in this direction is to deepen your knowledge of base R, for example by: studying R's key documents (which can be found by entering `help.start()` in the console), reading and playing with the source code of useful functions, or reading comprehensive resources on the subject such those by @wickham_advanced_2014 and @chambers_extending_2016.
<!-- creating and querying simple spatial in Chapter \ref(spatial-class) -->

<!-- Many directions of travel could be taken after taking the geocomputational steps -->
Perhaps the most obvious direction of future learning is **discovering geocomputation with other languages**.
There are good reasons for learning R as a language for geocomputation, as described in Chapter \@ref(intro), but it is not the only option.^[
R's strengths relevant to our definition geocomputation in,clude its emphasis on scientific reproducibility, widespread use in academic research and unparalleled support for statistical modelling of geographic data.
Furthermore we advocate learning one language (R) for geocomputation in depth before delving into other languages/frameworks because of the costs associated with context switching.
It is preferable to have expertise in one language than basic knowledge of many.

It is possible to study *Geocomputation with Python*, *C++*, *JavaScript*, *Scala*, *Julia* or *Rust* in equal depth.
Each of these is a promising language for geocomputation.
[**Turf.js**](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf), for example, provides many functions for geospatial analysis with implementations in JavaScript, Julia and even Swift.
[**rasterio**](https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio) is a Python package for raster offering a high-performance interface to GDAL for handling raster data.
These and other tantalizing geospatial software projects can be found on the GitHub repo [Awesome-Geospatial](https://github.com/sacridini/Awesome-Geospatial).

## Geocomputation for social benefit {#benefit}

This is a technical book so it makes sense for the next steps to be of a technical nature.
However, as we saw in section \@ref(what-is-geocomputation), geocomputation originated as a field that has three main ingredients:

- the *creative* use of geographic data
- application to *real world problems* for social benefit
- building new tools

We emphasize the first two ingredients because these broader non-technical aims make geospatial analysis so rewarding:
what is the point of building new new geographic method (tool) if its only purpose is to increase sales of perfume?
None.

Building on the three key components of geocomputation mentioned above and described in early work [@openshaw_geocomputation_2000], we added another: reproducibility.
Reproducibility is a worthwhile aim in itself but it also supports *creativity* and the application of geographic methods to *real world problems*.
Reproducibility encourages the focus of methods to shift away from the basics
<!-- (which are readility available through shared code) -->
and toward unusual applications.
<!-- that nobody has yet thought of. -->
Reproducibility encourages geocomputation for social benefit because it makes geographic data analysis publicly accessible and transparent.

Think of the person using geocomputation to increase sales of perfume.
They have developed a powerful new method combining multiple geographic data sources.
If only people in the company have access to the underlying code, few people benefit.
If they make their code open and reproducible, by contrast, the methods can be re-used for socially beneficial purposes.
Furthermore, if they contribute upstream to packages they have used for their work, everyone benefits.
One accessible way to contribute upstream is creating a reprex (reproducible example) to highlight a bug in the package's issue tracker, as outlined in section \@ref(scripts). 

<!-- Like any worthwhile intellectual endeavour or nascent academic field geocomputation is diverse and contested. -->
<!-- An editorial celebrating '21+ years of geocomputation' reflects on two decades of research that falls under the geocomputational banner [@harris_more_2017]. -->
